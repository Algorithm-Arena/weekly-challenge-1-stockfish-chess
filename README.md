# Weekly Challenge #1 - Stockfish Chess

This is the first edition of a weekly programming challenge that I'm going to host. The idea is to spur people's creativity. I used to run this kind of contest on [SC2Mapster.com](https://sc2mapster.com/) where every week I would come up with a map concept. It worked worked really well for mapping competition, I figured that this format would also work for programmers, yet I've not seen this kind of challenge anywhere.

**For the first challenge, you need to create a way to play chess 1v1 against a bot using the normal chess rules. The twist is that you need to use stockfish to spice up the game in an interesting way.**

To give some ideas around what it could be, [GothamChess came up with a rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYPpd89wFTQ) where he can request stockfish's best move one time and if he loses to the bot, 2 times, then 3 times... until he can defeat the bot. Another idea would be to swap the board whenever the bot has an advantage... Use your imagination to come up with interesting ways to play against a bot using stockfish.
